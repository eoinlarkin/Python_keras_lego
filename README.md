# python_keras_lego

##Overview
This code implements an image classification model to identify LEGO pieces utilising the Keras deep-learning framework. 
This project has been inspired by an article on the IEE Spectrum website which detailed a LEGO sorting machine that used a machine learning model to classify individual LEGO pieces. 

##Dataset
For the purposes of the initial version of the model, images of Lego bricks have been sourced from a public dataset available from the statistical learning website Kaggle.com [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images).

The dataset contains 400 images for different types of LEGO pieces. The Lego bricks have been created using the Blender 3D Modelling application. Each individual image displays the bricks from a different angle.

For the purposes of training and testing the initial version of the model, I have decided to focus on four distinct brick types:
•	3022 Plate 2by2
•	3069 Flat Tile 1by2	
•	3040 Roof Tile 1by2by46deg
•	6632 Technic Lever 3M
